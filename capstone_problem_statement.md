## Problem Statement for Capstone Project: AI-Based Prediction of Road Accidents and Road Rage Using Traffic Data

**Research Question:**
Can machine learning models accurately predict the occurrence and severity of road accidents—and identify risks related to road rage incidents—by analyzing publicly available traffic and behavioral data from US road networks?

**Expected Data Sources:**

The analysis will utilize the US Accidents dataset from Kaggle, filtered by state (such as California, Texas, or another of interest). The dataset contains millions of accident records across the US, but the analysis will be limited to one chosen state for computational feasibility and model relevance. 

**Techniques to Use in the Analysis:**

- Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on state-specific traffic, weather, and behavioral factors
- Machine learning models (such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression) with algorithm selection based on the data volume and complexity
- Time-series analysis to study patterns over time and geography within the state
- Appropriate model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, etc

**Expected Results:**

- Development of a prediction model for road accident occurrence and severity at the state level
- Identification of high-risk factors and locations (hotspots) within the state
actionable recommendations that can support state agencies in targeted safety investigations 

**Why This Question Is Important:**

- Road accidents and rage incidents cause significant loss of life, injuries, and economic harm each year
- Predictive models can enable targeted interventions, better resource allocation, and real-time warnings
- These solutions contribute to public safety, policy effectiveness, and the advancement of intelligent transportation systems
