## Severity and Impact Analysis

### Severity Distribution
- **Severity Levels**: Majority of accidents fall into Severity 2 (moderate impact) category
- **Severe Incidents**: Severity 3 and 4 incidents represent ~15% of total accidents but have disproportionate traffic impact
- **Duration Impact**: Higher severity accidents correlate with longer traffic impact duration

### Impact Duration Patterns
- **Short Duration**: Most accidents (>80%) resolved within 2-3 hours
- **Extended Impact**: Accidents with >4 hour duration typically involve severe incidents or complex cleanup
- **Traffic Flow**: Longer duration accidents show higher severity scores and greater traffic disruption

3. **Environmental**: Reduced visibility conditions and adverse weather
4. **Infrastructure**: Complex intersections with multiple traffic control devices

### Protective Factors
1. **Clear Weather**: Significantly lower severity in optimal weather conditions
2. **Traffic Calming**: Areas with speed reduction measures show lower severity
3. **Weekend Periods**: Lower overall incident frequency during weekends

### Data-Driven Recommendations
1. **Targeted Enforcement**: Focus on high-risk counties and cities during peak hours
2. **Infrastructure Improvements**: Enhanced safety measures at major intersections
3. **Weather-Based Alerts**: Real-time warnings during adverse weather conditions
4. **Seasonal Campaigns**: Increased safety awareness during fall/winter months
